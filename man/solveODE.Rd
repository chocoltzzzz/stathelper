\usage{
solveODE(a, b, c, f = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Numeric. The coefficient of the second derivative term (\eqn{y''}).}

\item{b}{Numeric. The coefficient of the first derivative term (\eqn{y'}).}

\item{c}{Numeric. The coefficient of the function term (\eqn{y}).}

\item{f}{Character or numeric. The forcing function \eqn{f(x)}. Can be:
- \code{NULL} for a homogeneous equation.
- A constant numeric value.
- A string representing \eqn{f(x)} in forms like "x", "exp(kx)", "kx", or "sin(kx)".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Complementary_Solution}}{Character. The complementary solution \eqn{y_c}.}
    \item{\code{Particular_Solution}}{Character. The particular solution \eqn{y_p}, or \code{"Unsupported forcing function"} if \eqn{f(x)} is invalid.}
  }
}
\description{
This function solves second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form:
\deqn{a y'' + b y' + c y = f(x)}
It computes both the complementary solution (\eqn{y_c}) and the particular solution (\eqn{y_p}) if a forcing function \eqn{f(x)} is provided.
}
\details{
The function determines the complementary solution based on the discriminant of the characteristic equation:
\deqn{r^2 + \frac{b}{a}r + \frac{c}{a} = 0.}
- If the discriminant is positive, it provides two real roots (\eqn{r_1} and \eqn{r_2}).
- If zero, it provides one repeated root (\eqn{r}).
- If negative, it provides complex roots.

For the particular solution, the function attempts to match the forcing function \eqn{f(x)} with common forms (constant, polynomial, exponential, sinusoidal) and calculates \eqn{y_p}.
