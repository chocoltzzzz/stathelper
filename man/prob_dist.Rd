\title{Probability Distribution Function Calculator}
\usage{
prob_dist(type, x, params, cumulative = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of distribution.
Must be one of: "normal", "binomial", or "poisson".}

\item{x}{A numeric value or vector at which the probability mass or density function is evaluated.}

\item{params}{A named list containing the parameters for the selected distribution.
- For "normal", provide `mean` and `sd`.
- For "binomial", provide `size` and `prob`.
- For "poisson", provide `lambda`.}

\item{cumulative}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is returned;
if `FALSE`, the probability density or mass function (PDF or PMF) is returned.}
}
\value{
A numeric value or vector representing the evaluated probability (or cumulative probability)
  based on the distribution type and the provided parameters.
}
\description{
This function calculates the probability or cumulative probability for the given type of distribution:
normal, binomial, or poisson. It supports both probability density and cumulative probability
calculations based on the provided input.
}
\details{
The function uses the following distribution functions from R:
- `dnorm` and `pnorm` for the normal distribution.
- `dbinom` and `pbinom` for the binomial distribution.
- `dpois` and `ppois` for the Poisson distribution.
}
\examples{
# Normal distribution with mean = 0, sd = 1, calculate the probability density at x = 0
prob_dist("normal", 0, list(mean = 0, sd = 1))

# Binomial distribution with size = 10, prob = 0.5, calculate cumulative probability at x = 3
prob_dist("binomial", 3, list(size = 10, prob = 0.5), cumulative = TRUE)

# Poisson distribution with lambda = 2, calculate the probability mass at x = 3
prob_dist("poisson", 3, list(lambda = 2))
